# Pong
## About
This is the game pong made using the p5.js javascript library.
It can be played [here](https://pikachu03.github.io/pong_p5.js/).
## How to Play
Use the up and down arrow keys to control the player on the right.
Use the w and s keys to control the player on the left.
The first player to get to 20 points wins!
